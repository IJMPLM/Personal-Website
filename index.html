                                This is the Personal-Website of John Michael M. Iwag, the person shown in the picture, created this as a mark of his 
                                journey towards learning different technologies, beginning his first steps with static web development. He honestly
                                thought of considering this as his base site for his portfolio, however, just as how he struggled to make the animated 
                                text above, he also spent a lot of time thinking of the things he could possibly put here instead of learning how he
                                will put it here, so instead of pretending he learned a lot in a short period of time, he just decided to justify
                                the fun he went through in trying to put up this webpage, and by fun, it is not about him continuously referring to himself
                                in third-person but fun through pointing out how he can confidently say that he knows everything about the structure of this
                                webpage after building it from scratch and of course, he also left some means for him to be contacted for your opinions.

                                        and in honor of St. Theresa of Avila. It is a spacious school with a decent

                                        Unfortunately, it had to be closed due to conflicts of interest along the

                                        Mr. Robert Pascual.

                                        John Michael M. Iwag spent his entire elementary education in this school where
                                        he honed his fundamental understanding and grasping of several subjects. Time spent
                                        in this place is mostly insignificant for him due to it being a venue for general
                                        irrelevant knowledge which he only accepted out of discipline and respect towards his
                                        parents, with little concern to what he is actually learning and for what it is.
                                        But despite of that he still had his own moments.

                                        John Michael Iwag at a young age has been taught well with the supervision
                                        of his mother who was once a teacher herself. He still had to his part in studying
                                        and reviewing for his exams but given how present his parents are in enforcing good
                                        study habits to him, he attributes most of his elementary success to them.

                                        Apart from being young at that age, John Michael Iwag really find this period of 
                                        time either unmemorable or filled of trauma to be deserving of being forgotten. 
                                        But it is no different from every other past experience he has had even later in life
                                        and there are still people and events he can recall from this time but most of them will
                                        probably not come back on their own without being brought up again by someone else. Regardless,
                                        this time period is filled of rigorous book-based studying for John Michael Iwag which created 
                                        a strong knowledge foundation for him.

                                    <p>
                                        Para√±aque Science High School (PSHS) was concerned in 1988 by the late Mayor Walfrido N. Ferrer and his 
                                        sister Mrs. Flor Cordero. It envisioned to provide free quality secondary education to the exceptionally 
                                        bright elementary graduates of Para√±aque, by having an enriched curriculum in Science, Engineering, Technology 
                                        and Mathematics. The idea of establishing a science high school was made after the success of Para√±aque Municipal 
                                        High School (PMHS) students in the 1988 Regional Science Fair. <br>
                                        Their vision was referred to the Principal of 
                                        Para√±aque Municipal High School (now Para√±aque National High School) Mrs. Rosa V. Sioson, with other school 
                                        administrator: Miss Narcisa F. Catindig, Assistant Principal and Department Head of Mathematics; Mrs. Teresita Flores, 
                                        Department Head of English; and Mrs. Elizabeth C. Cabales, Department Head of Science. This was approved by the 
                                        Division Superintendent, Dr. Ricardo Sibug and the OIC Science Supervisor, Mr. Lino Rom, who signified their support 
                                        to the notion. Their collaboration marked the birth of PSHS in 1990. With twenty-one (21) students housed in a borrowred 
                                        classroom of PMHS, and teachers, supervised by the PMHS administrators, PSHS has proven its exceptionality.

                                        John Michael Iwag spent most of his growth in this safe space for what was deemed as advance learning. Despite of beginning
                                        his academic venture with a lost note and some reluctance to even take an entrance exam in this school, it is one of the decisions
                                        he will never regret later in life not only for the quality education served from this institution, but also for the people he met and 
                                        taught him several things in life that led to what he is now.

                                        Not only did 2 years of JM's education being amidst the pandemic where Para√±aque Science High School 
                                        stepped in to continue providing quality education but also managed to teach JM several things in life
                                        particularly towards empathy and love for seeking knowledge. In contrast with the JM before he entered
                                        this school, he departed as someone who is highly-driven by his need to prove himself after realizing
                                        that he lived a sedative academic lifestyle in one of the most competitive yet comfortable learning atmosphere.
                                        And with that, he is on his journey to fulfill what he always wanted through learning how to build it.

                                        The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (from 'University of the City of Manila', 
                                        abbreviated as PLM) is a city-government-funded local university situated inside the 
                                        historic walled area of Intramuros, Manila, Philippines. It was established on June 
                                        19, 1965, and opened on July 17, 1967, to 556 scholars, all coming from the top ten 
                                        percent of graduates of Manila's public high schools.

                                        PLM is the first tertiary-level institution in the country to offer tuition-free education, 
                                        the first university funded solely by a city government, and the first institution of higher 
                                        learning in the country to have its official name in Filipino.
                                        
                                        From its first enrollment record of 556 freshman scholars coming from the top ten percent of 
                                        the graduating classes of Manila's twenty-nine public high schools, total semestral enrollment 
                                        has grown to an average of 10,000. The college has expanded from a single college to twelve 
                                        colleges, seven graduate, two professional schools, and a score of research and 
                                        specialized centers, including a teaching hospital, an entrepreneurial center, and an 
                                        integrated learning center for toddlers. It maintains a comprehensive distance-education and 
                                        open university program for thousands of community health workers and public administrators 
                                        in different regions nationwide, with affiliations and recognition from various national and 
                                        international organizations and institutions.
                                        
                                        A study using cumulative data from 1999 to 2003 showed that PLM was among the top five schools 
                                        nationwide in terms of board exam passing rate, and was one of three public universities in the 
                                        top ten category.

                                        as he holds pride for being a non-manila student in his priority course in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila.

                                        does not have much to show, well that's what he thought at firts. He came into decision that one of the 
                                        advantages of a website in showing one's skills is it being a multimedia platform allowing development 
                                        skills to be showcased unlike a printed resume or similar documents.

                                        He believes that what makes someone knowledgeable is knowing how the thing works as a whole, and able to identify
                                        all the wrong things within the project.
