                            This is the Personal-Website of John Michael M. Iwag, the person shown in the picture, created this as a mark of his 
                            journey towards learning different technologies, beginning his first steps with static web development. He honestly
                            thought of considering this as his base site for his portfolio, however, just as how he struggled to make the animated 
                            text above, he also spent a lot of time thinking of the things he could possibly put here instead of learning how he
                            will put it here, so instead of pretending he learned a lot in a short period of time, he just decided to justify
                            the fun he went through in trying to put up this webpage, and by fun, it is not about him continuously referring to himself
                            in third-person but fun through pointing out how he can confidently say that he knows everything about the structure of this
                            webpage after building it from scratch and of course, he also left some means for him to be contacted for your opinions.
